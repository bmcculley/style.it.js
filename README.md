# style.it.js

A mostly useless jQuery library, to dynamically add style to a page.

The style can be persistent across page loads by storing the CSS in a cookie. But, this has it limitations. Cookie values can only be 4096 bytes, however some browsers don't even support this many bytes. It might be possible to use multiple cookies to get around this issue, maybe in a future release.
